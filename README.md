## Lecture 2: *Universal Human Values*  
**Speaker:** Priya Ma’am

### Core Theme:
Understanding and aligning one’s life with the **Basic Aspiration** — continuous happiness and prosperity — rather than chasing disconnected short-term goals.

### Activity Reflection:
Participants reviewed personal aspirations (चाहना) and concerns (चिंता). A common pattern emerged:

**Aspirations:**
- Academic excellence  
- Good job with high salary  
- Family pride and personal happiness  

**Concerns:**
- Peer pressure  
- Lack of confidence  
- Time constraints  
- Stage fear  
- Lack of discipline

### The "Why?" Chain of Reflection:
1. **What are you doing?** → e.g., Studying hard  
2. **Why?** → To become an engineer  
3. **Why?** → To earn money and respect  
4. **Why?** → To be happy and prosperous  

This reflective chain led to the realization that:
> **All efforts ultimately aim at achieving lasting happiness and prosperity.**

### Life Planning Approaches:
- **Linear (1 → 2 → 3 → 4):** Acting without deeper clarity of purpose  
- **Reverse (4 → 3 → 2 → 1):** Starting with clarity of aspiration, then planning steps  

The reverse approach was emphasized as more effective and resilient during setbacks (e.g., failing to get into a dream college or not getting a preferred roommate).

### Key Takeaways:
- Understand your **Basic Aspiration** clearly  
- View career and academic achievements as **means**, not the **end**  
- If one path fails, find another without losing purpose  
- Reflect on past disappointments to evaluate your reaction and growth

### Assignment:
- Reflect on whether *continuous happiness and prosperity* is your true aspiration  
- Recall a moment when a desired path closed and analyze your response
